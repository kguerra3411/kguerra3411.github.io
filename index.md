### CPSC 120

* Lab 03

    Starting off in this computer science lab was scary for me personally as I had no 
    clue what I was getting myself into, this however is why lab 3 part 1 will be one 
    of my favorites. I liked it because it was one of the first labs where I started 
    to understand what was happening and seeing how each of the different parts worked 
    made me happy. I learned how to use std::cout and std::cin statements in an 
    effective way and understand how the user interacts with a program in this case to 
    make a sandwich. 

* Lab 07

    As I started to get more comfortable I ran into a lab that challenged me, that lab 
    being lab 7 part 2 that focused on a program of the game blackjack . I was pushed
    with the challenge of learning how functions worked and different types of  
    variables. Though this was very new to me I enjoyed this lab because it challenged 
    me and allowed me to expand my knowledge on my own for the first time as I had 
    been learning. 

* Lab 10

    One of my more recent labs was lab 10 part 1 in which I was put to find an area of 
    a rectangle. In this lab I learned to use both .h and .cc files to reach a common 
    goal and put work between multiple files using functions, vectors, and if 
    statements to make it possible. Though this lab introduced more concepts I was not 
    completely comfortable with, I enjoyed working between these different files and 
    understanding how they all connected to one another and seeing how concepts have 
    advanced this far into the course made me excited to understand more.
